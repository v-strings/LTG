# The Dale Chronicales 


Dale E. Wilson, also known as LowTierGod, has a history he is actively attempting to conceal. He employs tactics such as false DMCA strikes, legal actions, and intentional ignorance to suppress his past from his current audience. The purpose of this project is to unveil the undisclosed aspects of his history that he is striving to keep hidden from public awareness.


## Sources

I plan to utilize tweets, screenshots, and recorded live videos from members of the community as my sources. After each stream, Dale frequently deletes his content, and his consistent banning behavior makes it difficult to obtain official sources. Therefore, I intend to present multiple sources from individuals who have been impacted by his actions and who have managed to capture recorded videos.
